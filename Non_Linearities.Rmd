## Background

Individual participant data(IPD) meta-analysis(MA) is considered the gold standard since a variety of opportunities are offered. The investigation of treatment-effect modification is one of them, Nevertheless, effect modification over a continuous co-variables may be challenging, as non-linear interactions may be present. Most methods either ignore non-linear effect modification, or use a forward technique to model non-linearities that relies on statistical tests with arbitrary significance levels.

## Objective 
We propose a new approach to model and investigate treatment-effect modification, while modelling non-linear associations using smoothing splines.

# 1. Introduction

####### Personalised treatment often involves investigating treatment effect differences across a continuous effect modifier. When combining information from multiple studies in an indvidual participant data meta-analysis, this may be a challenging task due to non-linearities. The strategies currently followed involve either ignoring, estimating or accounting for functional shapes. Nevertheless, methods that offer more flexibility are available. 


#######  A naive approach is to ignore a non-linear functional form either through categorisation or by making linearity assumptions. Categorization may be used to investigate effect modification. Hereby, the effect modifier is categorised into subgroups, due to some clinical reasoning. For instance, the risk of developing cancer may be associated with menopause. Therefore, if age is a potential effect modifier it is reasonable to categorise the age to younger ($\leq$ 50 years older) and older (> 50 years old) participants. Due to loss of information categorization has been criticised for misspecification, reduced power, inflation of the type I error rate and biased results [@Royston_2005 ; @Altman_2006 ; @Austin_2004 ; @Maxwell_1993 ; @Weinberg_1995]. Another common practice is to use the continuous variable as it is, and therefore assume normality. This approach may also lead to deterioration of power, misspecification, and biased results if the true relationship is not linear [@J_rgensen_2016]. 

####### When estimating the functional form most current approaches involve stepwise methods, statistical tests with arbitrary significance levels and/or a-priori assumptions. Nevertheless, more flexible approaches are also available. 









#######  For this, various approaches to account for non-linear associations have been developed, such as splines and fractional polynomials (FP) [@Sauerbrei_2011]. For IPD-MA, regression-based approaches such as linear models, piecewise polynomials, FPs and smoothing splines may be performed either in one or two stages. In a two-stage approach, each trial is first modelled separately using an appropriate statistical model. Subsequently, we pool either the extracted coefficients if shared across the trials or their fitted functions, using standard meta-analytical tools. In contrast, in one-stage IPD-MA the IPD from all trials are analysed simultaneously whilst accounting for the clustering of participants within studies  . Hereto, we model interactions between treatment and patient-level variables while accounting also for the shape of the associations with the outcome. Recent recommendations suggest mean-centring the potential effect modifiers per trial in order to account for potential ecological   bias due to unadjusted confounding. In such a one-stage model, within-trial clustering can be accounted for using either a fixed effect (common intercept/slope), fixed effects (stratified intercept/slope), or random effects [@Legha_2018]. Other methods   to explore effect modification are plot- and tree-based methods such as the generalised linear mixed-effects model tree (GLMM-tree) method [@Wang_2016] or meta-stepp, a moving average (sliding window) method. 



Furthermore, although the association between the outcome and the continuous effect modifier is highly informative, clinical decisions are based on subgroups of participants the differ in treatment response. Finally, subgroups generated from continuous variables are defined by the cut-points were the treatment effect is considered to change. These cut-points may be based on the treatment effect function [@@royston_interaction_2013], i.e. the difference between the two treatments over the range of the covariable or the treatment-effect modifier interaction terms [@Sun_2010]. 
\par        Although there is a large variety of methods to explore effect modification for continuous covariates, little guidance exists on their use. We aim to describe and illustrate the aforementioned methods by applying them on two empirical examples, while discussing their (potential) advantages and limitations.



Both categorisation and false functional form assumptions are prone to significant ecological bias. For instance, if the functional form of mortality and age is exponential and some trials have old participants while other young, both approaches can lead to biased pooled results.





A 'naive' approach to categorising the effect modifier into pre-specified groups or assuming linearity. For instance, researchers may split the co-variable of age into young and old participants. 



For instance, ignoring a non-linear association between the outcome and potential effect modifier may produce biased results.

# 2. Methods

In our study we advocate the use of generalised additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) with smoothing splines to model and detect treatment effect modification by a continuous variable. For that, we will show results from one simulated extreme scenario and 2 real life empirical examples.

## 2.1 Data-set
## 2.1.1 Simulated data-set

We simulated 1 IPD-set which we considered an extreme case with 5 RCTs with 100 participants each, including 4 variables: 1) a binary variable **T** which corresponds to treatment 2) a uniformly distributed co-variable **Age** ranging from 30 to 60 years old and 3) a variable to indicate trial membership 4) a continuous outcome **Y**. We assumed equal treatment allocation for all trials, but different age groups randomised per trial, see table 1. **Age** was linearly associated with **Y** in the control group and quadratically in the treated group. 

```{r fig.cap="Table 1." , out.width= "25%"}

a= as.data.frame(matrix(c(paste("trial", 1:5), c("30-40","35-45","40-50","45-55","50-60")), ncol=2, nrow=5))
a= tab_df(a, title = "Age ranges per trial", col.header =  c("Trial","Age range of the participants", file = "Figs/Table1.html"),  
    CSS = list(
    css.caption = 'font-weight: bold; text-align: center; font-size: 28;',
    css.centeralign = 'text-align: center; font-size: 22;', 
    css.firsttablecol = 'font-weight: bold;font-size: 22;', 
    css.firsttablerow = 'font-weight: bold;font-size: 22;'
  ))

```

We considered the following example. Patients with liver disease are randomly allocated to *placebo* and *drug*. After a period of time the difference in liver volume is meassured. We assumed that patients that received *placebo* had an 2.5%  decrease in all age categories. The treatment had no-effect on young patients (around 30), and as Age increased the treatment effect increased with a quadratic shape we assumed t. 

The linear predictor for the whole IPD-set was: 
$Y_{i} =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{Age} \times \frac{Age_{i} - 30}{60} + \beta_{Treat} \times Treatment_{i} + \beta_x \times (\frac{Age_{i} - 30}{60})^2 \times Treatment_{i} + \epsilon_{i}$

Notice that we don't vary the $\beta$s per trial. 
$\beta_{0}$ = -2.5, $\beta_{Treat}$ = 0 , $\beta_{Age}$ = 0, $\beta_{X}$ = 20

```{r }

IPD1=  data.frame(Trial = factor(rep(1:5, each = 100), levels = c(1:5), labels = paste("Trial",1:5)),
                  Age = c(runif(100, 30,40),runif(100, 35,45),runif(100, 40,50),runif(100, 45,55),runif(100, 50,60)),
                  Treatment = rbinom(1000, 1, 0.5))

IPD1$Age.d  =  round(((IPD1$Age - 30)/60),3)
IPD1$Y =  with(IPD1, -2.5 +0*Treatment+ 0* Age.d  - 20*I(Treatment*Age.d^2)  + rnorm(1000,0,1))
IPD1$Treat =  IPD1$Treatment                                                                 
IPD1$Treatment =factor(IPD1$Treatment, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Control", "Drug"))

a= ggplot(IPD1)+ 
  geom_point( aes(x= Age, y = Y, color = Trial, shape = Treatment))+

## 2.1.2 Empirical data-sets

#######  We use 2 IPD-sets to illustrate the aforementioned method. The first IPD-MA investigates the effect of antibiotics in children with acute otitis media [@Rovers_2006]. Rovers et al. collected IPD from 6 randomised clinical trials with a total of 1643 children, aged from 0-12 years old. The primary outcome was fever and/or ear-pain after 3-7 days (yes/no). They concluded that antibiotics were more beneficial in younger children (less than 2 years old) with bilateral acute otitis media. Bilateral acute otitis media (yes/no), age, otorrhea were investigated also separately for potential effect modification and only bilateral acute otitis media showed a significant result. The second IPD-set [@Gevers_2013] considers an IPD-MA to investigate the effect of somatostatin on liver volume reduction. Gevers et al. collected IPD from 3 randomised placebo-controlled trials with a total of 107 participants. In this example, the outcome was continuous (liver volume reduction), and age, sex, baseline liver volume, and diagnosis of either autosomal dominant polycystic liver or kidney disease were investigated for effect modification . They concluded that use of somatostatin was more beneficial for younger (<47) female patients. One of the 3 trials had a cross-over design, therefore participants were treated both with the active and the control treatment in different time periods. In order to use these data for our illustrative purposes, we removed the cross-over design and used all patients only once, by selecting half of the patients from the active period and the other half (sex and age-matched) from the control period. Therefore, differences between our results and those reported in the original article may occur.



## 2.2 Statistical approaches
## 2.2.1 Notation

As described in section 2, both empirical example datasets are composed of multiple randomised trials. We will adopt the following notation throughout our manuscript:


* The trials as j = 1,2, ...,$N_j$, 
* Trial participants as i = 1,2, ...,$n_i$, 
* Standardised  $Age_{ij}  = \frac{Age_{ij} - 30}{60}$
* The per trial mean of age as $\overline{Age_j} = \overline{\frac{Age_{ij} - 30}{60}}$
 $Age_{ij} - \overline{Age_j}$




#### 2.2.1 Centred One-stage IPD-MA 

We follow recent recommendations [@Hua_2016] and centre per trial the continuous effect modifier. This way we can separate the within and across trial information of the effect modification. We considered two models one assuming linearity in both treatment arms and one assuming quadratic shape for the treated.


Therefore, the statistical models will be: 

$g(E(Y_{ij})) = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{Tj} \times Treatment_{ij} + \beta_A \times Treatment_{ij} \times  \overline{Age_j}  + \beta_{W} \times Treatment_{ij} \times (Age_{ij} - \overline{Age_j})$   and  $g(E(Y_{ij})) = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{Tj} \times Treatment_{ij} + \beta_A \times Treatment_{ij} \times  \overline{Age_j}  + \beta_{W} \times Treatment_{ij} \times (Age_{ij} - \overline{Age_j})^2$    where:

$\beta_{0j} \stackrel{}{\sim} Norm(b_0, \sigma_0^2)$,  $\beta_{Tj} \stackrel{}{\sim} Norm(b_T, \sigma_T^2)$, and $\beta_A$ and $\beta_w$ where considered fixed.


#### 2.2.2 Two-stage meta-analysis of fractional polynomials


Royston and Sauerbrei [@Royston_2004] proposed fractional polynomials as a flexible approach to detect non-linear associations, with interactions using the multivariable fractional polynomials interaction (MFPI) approach. Subsequently, they extended their approach to IPD-MA [@Sauerbrei_2011]. For more technical details and the discussion of three variants of the algorithm, we refer to Royston and Sauerbrei[@Royston_2009].

Hereto, the within each trial statistical model is :

$g(E(Y_{i})_j) = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{Tj} \times Treatment_{ij} + \beta_{X} \times Treatment_{ij} \times (Age_{ij})= \hat g_{c_j}(Age) + \hat g_{T_j}(Age)$ 

As a second step we extracted is the treatment effect function.

$Tr_j(Age)= \hat g_{T_j}(Age) -  \hat g_{c_j}(Age)$

Subsequently we pooled the treatment effect functions using a point wise meta-analysis [@White_2018]. 





#### 2.2.3 Generalised additive mixed effects models

Generalised additive models are a form of penalised generalised linear models. One type of penalization is identical to the random effects’ technique introduced by McCullagh et al. [@McCullagh_1983] in the generalised mixed effects models. There we can estimate a separate functional form per trial, given the fixed effects parameters. Therefore, per trial and treatment regime a different shape will be estimate. 

The statistical model will be:

$g(Y_{ij}) = s(Age)_{kj}$, where k the treatment regime.

# Discussion

In our paper, we described and illustrated a new approach to model and investigate effect modification when the potential effect modifier is not linearly associated with the outcome. Furthermore, we applied our method on two empirical examples and one extreme-case simulated IPD-set. Clinical decision making may be based on either relative or absolute treatment effects. Our results show that it may be important to account for the outcome-variable functional shape. Two-stage methods suffered from ecological bias in our simulated example. Finally, we showed that effect modification may not be linear and therefore not possible to be encapsuled in a single interaction term. Thus treatment effect functions along with illustrative methods such treatment effect plots may be better options for decision making.





## 5.1 Comparison with literature


## 5.2 Strengths and limitations
The major strength of our paper is that we propose a novel approach for IPD-MA of RCTs. Particularly, we considered generalised additive mixed effects models with smoothing splines. We showed that smoothing splines make minimal shape assumptions as they minimise the sum of maximum likelihood and a penalty term for the wingliness of the line.

## 5.3 Implications for practice

We believe that our approach may change the point of view of IPD-MA conducted. Specifically, the naive idea that....


## 5.4 Conclusions
We propose the use of one-stage generalised additive model with smoothing spline. This approach makes no assumptions over the functional shape and the cut-point where it changes. Finally, when combined with the treatment effect plot researchers .
